# Background
It is a simulation for the author to understand the behaviour of a fibre optic hydrophone (FOH). An FOH can be regarded as a Fabry-Perot-Interferometer (FPI) when it is served as an ultrasound sensor. 

## Fabry-Perot-Interferometer as an ultrasound sensor.
An FPI consists of a pair of mirrors. In certain conditions, the light trasmits into this pair of mirror would fully transmit through this pair of mirrors, and no reflection would occur. This is known as Fabry-Perot resonance. 


The R script `Simulation-Fabry-Perot-interferometer.r` simulates the transfer function the reflection intensity as a function of the optical phase.
